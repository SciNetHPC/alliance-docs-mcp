This page contains instructions on how to set up and access Arbutus object storage with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), one of the  object storage clients  available for this storage type.

Compared to other object storage clients, AWS CLI has better support for large (>5GB) files and the helpful sync command. However, not all features have not been tested.

pip install awscli awscli-plugin-endpoint

[plugins]

  endpoint_url = https://object-arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca
