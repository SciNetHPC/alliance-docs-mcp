= Introduction =

Apache Spark is an open source framework for distributed computation initially developed by the AMPLab at Berkeley University and is now a project sponsored by the Apache foundation. Unlike the MapReduce algorithm implemented by Hadoop that uses disk storage, Spark makes use of primitives which are stored in memory, thereby achieving up to 100x the performance of Hadoop in certain applications. Loading data in memory allows them to be queried frequently, making Spark a framework especially appropriate for automated learning and interactive data analysis.

= Usage =

== PySpark ==

== Java Jars  ==

= Monitoring =

The event log for the Spark application which was executed can be saved for later examination by means of a Web application provided by Spark. The following instructions show how to activate the saving of the event logs and how to start the Web application.

== Configuration ==
First create a directory which will contain the event log of the application:

If it doesn't already exist, next create a directory which will contain the Spark configuration parameters:

In this directory, create the following file or add the content shown to the file spark-defaults.conf if it already exists.

== Visualization ==

Create a tunnel between your computer and the cluster.

Load the Spark module:

Start the Web application for visualizing the event log:
1 start-history-server.sh
|result=
