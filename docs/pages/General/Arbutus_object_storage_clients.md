For information on obtaining Arbutus Object Storage, please see this page. For information on how to use an object storage client to manage your Arbutus object store, choose a client and follow instructions from these pages:
*  Accessing object storage with s3cmd
*  Accessing object storage with WinSCP
* Accessing the Arbutus object storage with AWS CLI
* Accessing the Arbutus object storage with Globus

It is important to note that Arbutus' Object Storage solution does not use Amazon's S3 Virtual Hosting (i.e. DNS-based bucket) approach which these clients assume by default. They need to be configured not to use that approach, as described in the pages linked above.
