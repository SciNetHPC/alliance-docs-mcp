== Description ==

BEASTBEAST2 Homepage: http://beast2.org/ is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular  sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using  strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies  but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single  tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted  proportional to its posterior probability.

BEAST can use the beagle-libBeagle-lib Homepage: https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib, which is a high-performance library that can perform the core calculations at the heart of most Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetics packages.

== Usage ==

Loading the BEAST module with: module load beast, will automatically load it's dependencies, namely the beagle-lib and java modules, and set the environment variable EBROOTBEAST to point to the directory where BEAST's program files are located.

=== Managing BEAST Packages/Add-ons ===

BEAST has been installed without any packages (add-ons). You can use the packagemanager command (for BEAST v2.5.1 and newer; in older versions of BEAST, the command is addonmanager) to install the desired packages within your home directory.

  $ module load beast/2.5.1
  $ packagemanager -list
