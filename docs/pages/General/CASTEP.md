==Installing CASTEP==
For example, with version 20.11:
# You must get the archive file that contains the installer; this file should be named CASTEP-20.11.tar.gz.
# Upload the CASTEP-20.11.tar.gz file to your /home/$USER folder on the cluster you intend to use.
# On the cluster, run the command:
 [name@server ~]$ eb CASTEP-20.11-iofbf-2020a.eb --sourcepath=$HOME --disable-enforce-checksums
Once this command has completed, log out from the cluster and log back in.

==Using CASTEP==
You should be able to load the module with:
 [name@server ~]$ module load castep
On a compute node, the CASTEP executable can be used like an MPI application:
 [name@server ~]$ srun castep.mpi seedname
Where input files would be seedname.cell and seedname.param (i.e. "seedname" could be a different name).
