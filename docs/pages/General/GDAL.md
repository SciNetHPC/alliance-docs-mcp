GDAL is an open source translator library for raster geospatial data formats.
It can be used as a a library, as which presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats.
It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing.

GDAL is used by a long list of software packages
and its functionality can be used in scripts written in Python or R.

== Using GDAL from Python ==
GDAL functionality can be used via the osgeo package,
which we install as an extension to the GDAL module. In order to use it, you need to load
a compatible Python module alongside the GDAL module.

=== Using osgeo under StdEnv/2020 ===
Check which Python modules are compatible with e.g. gdal/3.5.1:

We have the choice between Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. Let's choose python/3.10 for this.

=== Using osgeo under StdEnv/2023 ===
Check which Python modules are compatible with e.g. gdal/3.7.2:

We have the choice between Python 3.10 and 3.11. Let's choose python/3.11 for this.

== Using GDAL from R ==
Several R-packages for Analysis of Spatial Data directly depend on GDAL
as a System dependency. For example:
* sf: Simple Features for R
* terra: Spatial Data Analysis

The older package rgdal has been discontinued in favor of sf and terra.

=== Installing sf and terra under StdEnv/2020 ===
Installing these packages not only requires loading a gdal module, but also udunits
which is required by units.

=== Installing sf and terra under StdEnv/2023 ===
Note that under StdEnv/2023, in addition to modules gdal and udunits
also hdf/4.3.1 is required.
