GDB is a debugger used to investigate software problem.
GDB is an acronym saying GDB: The GNU Project Debugger

== Description ==
With a debugger, it is possible to quickly find the cause of a problem in a piece of software.
Often it is used to resolve segmentation faults.
If you desire to resolve a problem relating to memory (for example, a
memory leak), we recommend using  Valgrind.

== Use cases ==
=== Finding a bug with the debugger ===
In this section, the following program is used:

This program generates a segmentation fault when it is ran.

We may then run the program inside the debugger. Note that we compiled using the option -g to include debugging symbols within the binary and allow the debugger to provide more information on the bug. We run the program inside the debugger using
2, argv0x7fffffffda88) at program.cpp:15
15		cout << numbers[1000000] << endl;
Missing separate debuginfos, use: debuginfo-install glibc-2.16-31.fc18.x86_64 libgcc-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64 libstdc++-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64

(gdb) bt
#0  0x0000000000400c17 in main (argc2, argv0x7fffffffda88) at program.cpp:15
|
}}
So, the above error is caused by line 15. The code tries to use index 1000000, but the array only contains 1000 elements.

=== Finding the cause of a segmentation fault using a core file ===
In this example, we use the same program as in the previous section. We however do so without using the debugger directly. This is useful for a bug that happens a long time after the program has started.

To find the cause for this error, a core file must be generated. To do this, you must activate the creation of such files.

Executing the same program again, a core file is written.

Using the program binary executable and the core file, it is possible to trace its execution
up to the error.
1, argv0x7fff2315c848) at
program.cpp:15
15              cout << numbers[1000000] << endl;
Missing separate debuginfos, use: debuginfo-install
glibc-2.16-31.fc18.x86_64 libgcc-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64
libstdc++-4.7.2-8.fc18.x86_64

(gdb) bt
#0  0x0000000000400c17 in main (argc1, argv0x7fff2315c848) at
program.cpp:15
|
}}
We here get the same result as if we had run it inside the debugger.

=== Attaching the debugger to a running process ===
It is possible to debug a process that is already running, for example a job running on one of the compute nodes. To do so, we first need the process ID.

 grep firefox  grep -v grep
seb      12691  6.4  7.5 1539672 282656 ?      Sl   08:53   6:48 /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox http://www.google.ca/
}}

After that, it is possible to attach the debugger directly.

After having done this, a lot of information is displayed.

There are many commands available within GDB. One of the most useful is backtrace, or bt.
This commands shows the current call stack.

== Advanced usage ==
In the previous sections, we used the run and backtrace commands. Many more commands are available to debug in an interactive way, by stopping the program. For example, you can set breakpoints on functions or lines of code, or whenever a given variable is modified. When execution is interrupted, you can analyse the state of the program by printing the value of variables. The following table contains a list of the main commands.

Main GDB commands

Command          	Shortcut	Argument                     	Description
run/kill         	r/k     	-                            	begin/stop execution
where / backtrace	bt      	-                            	displays the backtrace
break            	b       	src.c:line_number or function	sets a break point at the given line of code or function
watch            	-       	variable name                	interrupts the program when a variable is modified
continue         	c       	-                            	resume the program
step             	s       	-                            	execute the next operation
print            	p       	variable name                	displays the content of a variable
list             	l       	src.c:number                 	displays the given line of code

=== Displaying STL structures ===
By default, GDB does not display C++ STL structures very well. Many solutions are given here. The simplest solution is probably this one, which is to copy this file in your home folder, with the name ~/.gdbinit.
