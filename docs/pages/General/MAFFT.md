MAFFT is a multiple sequence alignment program for unix-like operating systems.  It offers a range of multiple alignment methods, L-INS-i (accurate; for alignment of <∼200 sequences), FFT-NS-2 (fast; for alignment of <∼30,000 sequences), etc.

== Single node ==
MAFFT can benefit from multiple cores on a single node. For more information: https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/multithreading.html

Note: The MAFFT_TMPDIR is set to $SLURM_TMPDIR/maffttmp when you load the module.

== Multiple nodes (MPI) ==
MAFFT can use MPI to align a large number of sequences: https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/mpi.html

Note: MAFFT_TMPDIR is set to $SCRATCH/maffttmp when you load the module.
If you change this temporary directory, it must be shared by all hosts.
