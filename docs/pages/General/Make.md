== Description ==
make is a utility that automatically builds files, such as executables or libraries, from other files, such as source code.

The make command interprets and executes the instructions within a file named makefile. Unlike a simple script, make only executes the commands that are necessary. The goal is to arrive at a result (compiled or installed software, formatted documentation, etc.) without needing to redo all steps.

The makefile contains information on dependencies.
For example, if the makefile indicates that an object (.o) file depends on a source file, and the source file has changed, then the source file is recompiled to update the object file.
In the same way, if an executable depends on any object files which have changed then the linking step will be rerun to update the executable.
All dependencies must be included in the makefile. Then it is not necessary to recompile all files for every modification; the make command takes care of recompiling and relinking only what is necessary.

== Examples for using make ==
The main argument of the make command is the target. The target may be the name of some file that make should build, or it may be an abstract target such as all, test, check, clean, or install.
The targets that are available depend on the contents of the makefile, but the ones just listed are conventional and are
specified in many makefiles. If make is invoked with no target specified, like so:

then the typical behaviour is to construct everything, equivalent to:

The test or check targets are generally used to run tests to validate if the application or compiled library functions correctly. Usually these targets depend on the all target. Hence you can verify the compilation using

or

The clean target erases all previously compiled binary files to be able to recompile from scratch. There is sometimes also a distclean target, which not only deletes files made by make, but also files created at configuration time by configure or cmake. So to clean the compilation directory, you can usually run

and sometimes

The install target normally installs a compiled program or library. Where the installation is put depends on the makefile, but can often be modified using an additional prefix parameter, like this:
$HOME/PROGRAM}}

The targets all, test, check, clean, distclean and install are only conventions and a makefile author could very well choose another convention.
