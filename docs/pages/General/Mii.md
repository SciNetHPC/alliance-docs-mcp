A smart search engine for module environments.

Mii works around an existing modules installation, efficiently searching and loading modules on-demand for users.

Once Mii is loaded, modules will be quietly autoloaded for any unambiguous commands. Ambiguous commands will interactively ask for modules to load.

It features:
* Support for Lmod and Environment Modules installations
* bash and zsh shell integration
* Module listing / individual information (via mii list, mii show)
* Searching for exact commands (via mii exact)
* Searching for similar commands (via mii search)
* Optional JSON export format

= Ambiguous commands =
When a command or binary is unknown or ambiguous, it will suggest a selection of potential candidates based on their relevance:

As shown above, we selected one module (#1) out of the selection, and the command was then ran.

= Search with Mii =
You can search for binaries to discover which modules provides it. The results are sorted by relevance:
