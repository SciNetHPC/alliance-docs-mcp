__FORCETOC__

= Monitor GPUs usage =
NVTOP can monitor single or multiple GPUs. It can show the GPU usage and its memory.
One can also select a specific device from the menu (F2 -> GPU Select).

NVTOP is useful to monitor and verify that your job is using the GPU as efficiently as possible.

== Monitor batch job ==
If you have submitted a non-interactive job and would like to see its current GPU usage.

1. From a login node, find the job id and select the one to monitor:

2. Attach to the running job:

== Monitor interactive job ==
1. Start your interactive job with minimal resources.

2. In a second terminal, connect to the login node, find the job id:

3. Attach to the running job:

You'll be able to see the usage in real time as you run your commands in the first terminal.

== Monitor a GPU on a specific node ==
When running multi-nodes jobs, it can be useful to verify that one or all GPUs are effectively used.

1. From a login node, find the job id and identify the node names:

2. Attach to the running job on the specific node:
