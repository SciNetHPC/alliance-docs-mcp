Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO) software framework, particularly designed for machine learning.

Please refer to the Optuna Documentation for a definition of terms, tutorial, API, etc.

== Using Optuna on Compute Canada ==

Here is a sketch of an SBATCH script for an HPO using Optuna:

It's important for M to be much smaller than N, to let the optimization process do its thing. At the limit, if all trials execute simultaneously, they won't benefit from "past knowledge", and it will be equivalent to doing a random search. As for evolution and natural selection, there has to be a sequence of generations.

In train.py, create and launch the Optuna study like the following. For the rest of the code, see the Optuna Documentation.

 # args.optuna_db and args.optuna_study_name are command line arguments

 study = optuna.create_study(
     storage='sqlite:///' + args.optuna_db,
     study_name=args.optuna_study_name,
     load_if_exists=True
 )
 ...
 study.optimize(objective, n_trials=1)  # Only execute a single trial at a time, to avoid wasting compute

Remember that we are launching a separate job for each trial. Thus, we want our python script to stop after a single trial. Else, a subsequent trial will start, and the job will be killed while it's running.
