parasail is a SIMD C (C99) library containing implementations of the Smith-Waterman (local), Needleman-Wunsch (global), and various semi-global pairwise sequence alignment algorithms.

= Usage =

Find the required versions using

and load the library using

== parasail_aligner Example ==
When using the binary parasail_aligner, it is important to set the number of threads according to the number of cores allocated in our job. We can set it with

parasail_aligner -t ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK:-1} ...}}

== Python extension ==
The module contains bindings for multiple Python versions.
To discover which are the compatible Python versions, run

=== Usage ===
1. Load the required modules.

2. Import parasail 1.3.4.

If the command displays nothing, the import was successful.

=== Example ===
Run a quick local alignment score comparison between BioPython and parasail.

1. Write the Python script:

2. Write the job submission script:

2.1. Identify available wheels first :

Install the desired version in your virtual environment:

3. Submit the job with

4. When the job has run, the output will be in the Slurm output file:

==== Available Python packages  ====
Other Python packages that depend on parasail will have their requirement satisfied by loading the parasail module:
 grep parasail
|result=
parasail                           1.3.4
