== Description ==
Python is an interpreted programming language with a design philosophy stressing the readability of code. Its syntax is simple and expressive. Python has an extensive, easy-to-use standard library.

The capabilities of Python can be extended with packages developed by third parties. In general, to simplify operations, it is left up to individual users and groups to install these third-party packages in their own directories. However, most systems offer several versions of Python as well as tools to help you install the third-party packages that you need.

The following sections discuss the Python interpreter, and how to install and use packages.

== Loading an interpreter ==

===Default Python version===
When you log into our clusters, a default Python version will be available, but that is generally not the one that you should use, especially if you need to install any Python packages. You should try to find out which version of Python is required to run your Python programs and load the appropriate  module. If you are not sure which version you need, then it is reasonable to use the latest version available.

===Loading a Python module===
To discover the versions of Python available:

You can then load the version of your choice using module load. For example

where X.Y represent the version, for example 3.13.

===Python version supported===
In general in the Python ecosystem, the transition to more modern versions of python is accelerating, with many packages only supporting the latest few versions of Python 3.x. In our case, we provide prebuilt Python packages in our wheelhouse only for the 3 most recent Python versions available on the systems. This will result in dependencies issues when trying to install those packages with older versions of Python. See Troubleshooting.

=== SciPy stack ===

In addition to the base Python module, the SciPy package is also available as an environment module. The scipy-stack module includes:
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
** dateutil
** pytz
* IPython
** pyzmq
** tornado
* pandas
* Sympy
* nose

If you want to use any of these Python packages, load a Python version of your choice and then module load scipy-stack.

To get a complete list of the packages contained in scipy-stack, along with their version numbers, run module spider scipy-stack/2020a (replacing 2020a with whichever version you want to find out about).

== Creating and using a virtual environment ==

With each version of Python, we provide the tool virtualenv. This tool allows users to create virtual environments within which you can easily install Python packages. These environments allow one to install many versions of the same package, for example, or to compartmentalize a Python installation according to the needs of a specific project. Usually you should create your Python virtual environment(s) in your /home directory or in one of your /project directories.  (See "Creating virtual environments inside of your jobs" below for a third alternative.)

To create a virtual environment, make sure you have selected a Python version with module load python/X.Y.Z as shown above in section Loading a Python module.  If you expect to use any of the packages listed in section SciPy stack above, also run module load scipy-stack/X.Y.Z.  Then enter the following command, where ENV is the name of the directory for your new environment:

Once the virtual environment has been created, it must be activated:

You should also upgrade pip in the environment:

To exit the virtual environment, simply enter the command deactivate:

You can now use the same virtual environment over and over again.  Each time:
# Load the same environment modules that you loaded when you created the virtual environment, e.g. module load python scipy-stack
# Activate the environment, source ENV/bin/activate

=== Installing packages ===

Once you have a virtual environment loaded, you will be able to run the pip command. This command takes care of compiling and installing most of Python packages and their dependencies. A comprehensive index of Python packages can be found at PyPI.

All of pip's commands are explained in detail in the user guide. We will cover only the most important commands and use the Numpy package as an example.

We first load the Python interpreter:

where X.Y represent the version, for example 3.13.

We then activate the virtual environment, previously created using the virtualenv command:

Finally, we install the latest stable version of Numpy:

The pip command can install packages from a variety of sources, including PyPI and prebuilt distribution packages called Python wheels. We provide Python wheels for a number of packages. In the above example, the --no-index option tells pip to not install from PyPI, but instead to install only from locally available packages, i.e. our wheels.

Whenever we provide a wheel for a given package, we strongly recommend to use it by way of the --no-index option. Compared to using packages from PyPI, wheels that have been compiled by our staff can prevent issues with missing or conflicting dependencies, and were optimized for our clusters hardware and libraries. See Available wheels.

If you omit the --no-index option, pip will search both PyPI and local packages, and use the latest version available. If PyPI has a newer version, it will be installed instead of our wheel, possibly causing issues. If you are certain that you prefer to download a package from PyPI rather than use a wheel, you can use the --no-binary option, which tells pip to ignore prebuilt packages entirely. Note that this will also ignore wheels that are distributed through PyPI, and will always compile the package from source.

To see where the pip command is installing a python package from, diagnosing installation issues, you can tell it to be more verbose with the -vvv option. It is also worth mentioning that when installing multiple packages it is advisable to install them with one command as it helps pip resolve dependencies.

=== Creating virtual environments inside of your jobs ===

Note: On Trillium it is recommended to create virtual environments from a login node in HOME and source it in your job script.

Parallel filesystems such as the ones used on our clusters are very good at reading or writing large chunks of data, but can be bad for intensive use of small files. Launching a software and loading libraries, such as starting Python and loading a virtual environment, can be slow for this reason.

As a workaround for this kind of slowdown, and especially for single-node Python jobs, you can create your virtual environment inside of your job, using the compute node's local disk. It may seem counter-intuitive to recreate your environment for every job, but it can be faster than running from the parallel filesystem, and will give you some protection against some filesystem performance issues. This approach, of creating a node-local virtualenv, has to be done for each node in the job, since the virtualenv is only accessible on one node.  Following job submission script demonstrates how to do this for a single-node job:

where the requirements.txt file will have been created from a test environment. For example, if you want to create an environment for TensorFlow, you would do the following on a login node :
/tmp/$RANDOM
|virtualenv --no-download $ENVDIR
|source $ENVDIR/bin/activate
|pip install --no-index --upgrade pip
|pip install --no-index tensorflow
|pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
|deactivate
|rm -rf $ENVDIR
}}

This will yield a file called requirements.txt, with content such as the following

This file will ensure that your environment is reproducible between jobs.

Note that the above instructions require all of the packages you need to be available in the python wheels that we provide (see "Available wheels" below). If the wheel is not available in our wheelhouse, you can pre-download it (see "Pre-downloading packages" section below). If you think that the missing wheel should be included in our wheelhouse, please contact Technical support to make a request.

==== Creating virtual environments inside of your jobs (multi-nodes) ====

In order to run scripts across multiple nodes, each node must have its own virtual environment activated.

1. In your submission script, create the virtual environment on each allocated node:

srun --ntasks $SLURM_NNODES --tasks-per-node=1 bash << EOF

virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env
source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate

pip install --no-index --upgrade pip
pip install --no-index -r requirements.txt

EOF

2. Activate the virtual environment on the main node,
source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate;

3. Use srun to run your script
srun python myscript.py;

==== Example (multi-nodes) ====

=== Available wheels ===
Currently available wheels are listed on the Available Python wheels page. You can also run the command avail_wheels on the cluster.
By default, it will:
* only show you the latest version of a specific package (unless versions are given);
* only show you versions that are compatible with the python module (if one loaded) or virtual environment (if activated), otherwise all versions will be shown;
* only show you versions that are compatible with the CPU architecture and software environment (StdEnv) that you are currently running on.

==== Names ====
To list wheels containing cdf (case insensitive) in its name:

Or an exact name:

==== Version ====
To list a specific version, you can use the same format as with `pip`:
1.23
|result=
name    version    python    arch
------  ---------  --------  -------
numpy   1.23.0     cp39      generic
numpy   1.23.0     cp38      generic
numpy   1.23.0     cp310     generic
}}
Or use the long option:

With the pip format, you can use different operators : ==, <, >, ~=, <=,>=, !=. For instance, to list inferior versions:

And to list all available versions:

==== Python ====
You can list a specific version of Python:

The python column tells us for which version the wheel is available, where cp39 stands for cpython 3.9.

==== Requirements file ====
One can list available wheels based on a requirements.txt file with:

And display wheels that are not available:

=== Pre-downloading packages ===

Here is how to pre-download a package called tensorboardX on a login node, and install it on a compute node:

# Run pip download --no-deps tensorboardX. This will download the package as tensorboardX-1.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl (or similar) in the working directory. The syntax of pip download is the same as pip install.
# If the filename does not end with none-any, and ends with something like linux_x86_64 or manylinux*_x86_64, the wheel might not function correctly. You should contact Technical support so that we compile the wheel and make it available on our systems.
# Then, when installing, use the path for file pip install tensorboardX-1.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl.

=== Installing from a remote repository (Github) ===

In some cases the source package is not available on the python package index (PyPI), but it is available from a remote repository.
That remote repository may be Git, Subversion, Bazaar or Mercurial based but we'll focus on Git-based below.

Using the URL to the remote repository, you can specify:
* a branch name (the-best-feature)
* a tag (v1.0.1)
* a short or full commit identifier (da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709)
* a reference, like to a pull request (refs/pull/123/head)

With an activated virtual environment:

It is important to use a tag (version) or commit id in order to have a reproducible installation.
If you use the HEAD of the repository, it may (or may not) work today, but tomorrow may bring issues, as the authors have made some changes.

On Github, you can find the tags or releases under the Releases section on the right panel.

For more information on installing from a version control system (VCS), see vcs-support

== Parallel programming with the Python multiprocessing module ==

Doing parallel programming with Python can be an easy way to get results faster. A usual way of doing so is to use the multiprocessing module. Of particular interest is the Pool class of this module, since it allows one to control the number of processes started in parallel, and apply the same calculation to multiple data. As an example, suppose we want to calculate the cube of a list of numbers. The serial code would look like this :

Using the Pool class, running in parallel, the above codes become :

The above examples will however be limited to using 4 processes. On a cluster, it is very important to use the cores that are allocated to your job. Launching more processes than you have cores requested will slow down your calculation and possibly overload the compute node. Launching fewer processes than you have cores will result in wasted resources and cores remaining idle. The correct number of cores to use in your code is determined by the amount of resources you requested to the scheduler. For example, if you have the same computation to perform on many tens of data or more, it would make sense to use all of the cores of a node. In this case, you can write your job submission script with the following header :

and then, your code would become the following :

Note that in the above example, the function cube itself is sequential. If you are calling some external library, such as numpy, it is possible that the functions called by your code are themselves parallel. If you want to distribute processes with the technique above, you should verify whether the functions you call are themselves parallel, and if they are, you need to control how many threads they will take themselves. If, for example, they take all the cores available (32 in the above example), and you are yourself starting 32 processes, this will slow down your code and possibly overload the node as well.

Note that the multiprocessing module is restricted to using a single compute node, so the speedup achievable by your program is usually limited to the total number of CPU cores in that node.  If you want to go beyond this limit and use multiple nodes, consider using mpi4py or PySpark.  Other methods of parallelizing Python (not all of them necessarily supported on our clusters) are listed here. Also note that you can greatly improve  the performance of your Python program by ensuring it is written efficiently, so that should be done first before parallelizing.  If you are not sure if your Python code is efficient, please contact technical support and have them look at your code.

== Anaconda ==
Please see Anaconda.

== Jupyter ==
Please see Jupyter.

== Debugging ==

Debugging your python code might not be obvious. Simple methods such as adding print statement or assertion (assert) can help you fix some errors.

But often, it is required to dig a bit deeper in the code and its context, using a debugger such as pdb is then easier.

You can debug your Python code, in a small interactive job:

#. Add import pdb; pdb.set_trace() to the beginning of your file, or add breakpoint() at the desired location.
#. Run your code: python ...
#. You'll end up in the debugger and can now look around and evaluate expressions.

Useful commands:

Command      	Description
w (here)     	Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom. An arrow (>) indicates the current frame, which determines the context of most commands.
b (reak)     	With a lineno argument, set a break at line lineno in the current file.
s (tep)      	Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion (either in a function that is called or on the next line in the current function).
n (ext)      	Continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or it returns.
r (eturn)    	Continue execution until the current function returns.
c (ont(inue))	Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.
p exp        	Evaluate expression in the current context and print its value.
l (ist)      	List source code for the current file.
q (uit)      	Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.

Typically, one would use w, s, l, p, n to debug a file.

For more information, see the Python Debugger.

== Attaching to a running process ==
With Python 3.14 and higher, one can attach to a running process and start PDB at the current step.
In a different terminal, execute:

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Python script is hanging ===

By using the faulthandler module, you can edit your script to allow dumping a traceback after a timeout. See faulthandler.dump_traceback_later().

You can also inspect a python process while the job is running, without modifying it beforehand, using py-spy:

# Install py-spy in a virtualenv in your home
# Attach to the running job, using srun --pty --jobid JOBID bash
# Use htop -u $USER to find the process ID of your python script
# Activate the virtualenv where py-spy is installed
# Run py-spy top --pid PID to see live feedback about where your code is spending time
# Run py-spy dump --pid PID to get a traceback of where your code is currently at.

=== Package 'X' requires a different Python: X.Y.Z not in '>=X.Y'  ===
When installing packages, you may encounter an error similar to:
ERROR: Package 'X' requires a different Python: 3.6.10 not in '>=3.7'.

The current python module loaded (3.6.10 in this case) is not supported by that package. You can update to a more recent version, such as the latest available module. Or install an older version of package 'X'.

=== Package has requirement X, but you'll have Y which is incompatible  ===
When installing packages, you may encounter an error similar to:
ERROR: Package has requirement X, but you'll have Y which is incompatible..

Upgrade pip to the latest version or higher than [21.3] to use the new dependency resolver:

Then rerun your install command.

=== No matching distribution found for X ===
When installing packages, you may encounter an error similar to:

pip did not find a package to install that satisfies the requirements (name, version or tags).
Verify that the name and version are correct.
Note also that manylinux_x_y wheels are discarded.

You can also verify that the package is available from the wheelhouse with the avail_wheels command or by searching on Available Python wheels page.

=== Installing many packages  ===
When installing multiple packages, it is best to install them in one command when possible:

as this helps pip resolve dependencies issues.

=== My virtual environment was working yesterday but not anymore ===
Packages are often updated and this leads to a non-reproducible virtual environment.

Another reason might be that the virtual environment was created in $SCRATCH and part of it was deleted with the automatic purge of the filesystem; this would make the virtual environment nonfunctional.

To remedy that, freeze the specific packages and their versions with
X.Y' 'package2X.Y.Z' 'package3X.Y'
}}
and then create a requirements file that will be used to install the required packages in your job.

=== X is not a supported wheel on this platform ===
When installing a package, you may encounter the following error: ERROR: package-3.8.1-cp311-cp311-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

Some packages may be incompatible or not supported on the systems.
Two common cases are:
* trying to install a manylinux package
* or a python package built for a different Python version (e.g. installing a package built for python 3.11 when you have python 3.9).

Some manylinux package can be made available through the wheelhouse.

=== AttributeError: module ‘numpy’ has no attribute ‘X’ ===
When installing numpy without specifying a version number, the latest available version will be installed.
In Numpy v1.20, many attributes were set for deprecation and are now expired in v1.24.

This may result in an error, depending on the attribute accessed.  For example, AttributeError: module ‘numpy’ has no attribute ‘bool’.

This can be solved by installing a previous version of Numpy: pip install --no-index 'numpy<1.24'.

=== ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X' ===
When trying to import a Python module, it may not be found. Some common causes are:
* the package is not installed or is not visible to the python interpreter;
* the name of the module to import is not the same as the name of the package that provides it;
* a broken virtual environment.

To avoid such problems, do not:
* modify the PYTHONPATH environment variable;
* modify the PATH environment variable;
* load a module while a virtual environment is activated (activate your virtual environment only after loading all the required modules)

When you encounter this problem, first make sure you followed the above advice. Then:
* make sure that the package is installed; run pip list;
* double-check the module name (upper or lower case and underscores matter);
* make sure that the module is imported at the correct level (when importing from its source directory).

In doubt, start over with a new virtual environment.

=== ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import ===

When trying to import a Python module that depends on Numpy, one may encounter ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import.

This is caused by an incompatible version of Numpy installed or used and you must install a compatible version.

This is especially true with the release of Numpy 2.0 which breaks the ABI.
In the case of a wheel that was built with version 1.x but installed version 2.x, one must installed a lower version with: pip install --no-index 'numpy<2.0'

=== Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable ===
When installing packages, one may encounter the message Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable.

This is pip default behavior outside a virtual environment.
This means that no virtual environment was found nor activated and that pip tried to install in a location where it does not have permissions to do so.

This results in local installations which may be problematic.

=== Local installation (--user) ===
Local installation can occur unexpectedly (if an error occur with your virtual environment, or permissions issues) or by user defined installation (pip install --user).

Local installation is essentially dumping dependencies into one shared space, which is a recipe for headaches.
This creates weird import issues or runtime issues with your python packages, or version conflicts which could result in dependency hell.

Using a virtual environment is best for isolation, reproducibility and managing different versions across your different projects.

==== Remove local installation ====
To effectively remove local installations, one needs to:

Note that you may need to specify binaries directly if you are using the ~/.local/bin for local binaries (other than Python packages).

Once the local installations are removed, start over with  a clean fresh new virtual environment.
