__NOTOC__
:"Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.
:[...]

:Quantum ESPRESSO has evolved into a distribution of independent and inter-operable codes in the spirit of an open-source project. The Quantum ESPRESSO distribution consists of a “historical” core set of components, and a set of plug-ins that perform more advanced tasks, plus a number of third-party packages designed to be inter-operable with the core components.Quantum ESPRESSO web site.

= Usage =
To use Quantum ESPRESSO, you need to load a module (see Using modules). You can see available versions using module avail quantumespresso or module spider quantumespresso, and load one with (for example), module load quantumespresso/6.6.

The above example requests 32 processes, which is more than needed for the silicon tutorial case. Please be aware that suitable selection of a process count is complicated, but it is your responsibility to choose an efficient number.  See also Advanced MPI scheduling.

= Known problems =

== No pseudopotential files ==
There is no system-wide repository of pseudopotentials for Quantum ESPRESSO on our clusters. You must find or create and store your own pseudopotential files.

== Parameter error in Grimme-D3 ==

Incorrect results may be obtained when running Grimme-D3 with the element barium (Ba).
The error comes from an incorrect value for one of the coefficients for barium,
specifically, the r2r4 parameter in the source code file dft-d3/core.f90.
The correct value should be 10.15679528, not 0.15679528.
The error has been confirmed by the QE developers to exist in all versions from 6.2.1 to 7.1.
