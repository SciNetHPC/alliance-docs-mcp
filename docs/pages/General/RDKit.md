RDKit is a collection of cheminformatics and machine-learning software written in C++ and Python.

__FORCETOC__

= Available versions =
rdkit C++ libraries and Python bindings are available as a module.

You can find available versions with:

and look for more information on a specific version with:

where X.Y.Z is the exact desired version, for instance 2024.03.5.

= Python bindings =
The module contains bindings for multiple Python versions. To discover which are the compatible Python versions, run:

where X.Y.Z represents the desired version.

== rdkit as a Python package dependency ==
When rdkit is a dependency of another package, the dependency needs to be fulfilled:

1. Deactivate any Python virtual environment.

Note: If you had a virtual environment activated, it is important to deactivate it first, then load the module, before reactivating your virtual environment.

2. Load the module.

3. Check that it is visible by pip
 grep rdkit
|result=
rdkit            2024.3.5
}}

If no errors are raised, then everything is OK!

4. Create a virtual environment and install your packages.

= Troubleshooting =

== ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rdkit' ==
If rdkit is not accessible, you may get the following error when importing it:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rdkit'

Possible solutions:
* check which Python versions are compatible with your loaded RDKit module using module spider rdkit/X.Y.Z. Once a compatible Python module is loaded, check that python -c 'import rdkit' works.
* load the module before activating your virtual environment: please see the  rdkit as a package dependency section above.
