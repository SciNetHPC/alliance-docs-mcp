Installation of software packages within the Alliance software environment is always performed using scripts. We use multiple tools, including EasyBuild, Gentoo Overlays (starting in 2020), and NixOS (formerly). This software environment can be used on any computer in the world thanks to CVMFS.

We also track all changes and new installations made to the software environment through Git, and you can see a list of recent changes in the links below.

* Changes to the core modules and modules installed for the AVX2 CPU architecture
* Changes to the modules installed for the AVX512 CPU architecture
* Changes to the modules installed for the AVX CPU architecture
