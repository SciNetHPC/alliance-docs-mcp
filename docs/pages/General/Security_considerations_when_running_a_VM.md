On the cloud, you are responsible for the security of your virtual machines.

This document is not a complete guide, but will set out some things you need to consider when creating a VM on the cloud.

==Basic security talk recording==
There is a recording of an ~1.5 hr talk on some basic security considerations when working with VMs in the cloud available on youtube called Safety First!.

Below is a list of links to different sections of the recording for easier video navigation.
* Talk overview
* Cloud service levels
* General security principles
* Key topics
* Creating a first VM (with some comments about security)
* OpenStack security groups
* SSH Security
* Logs
* Creating backups of VMs

==Keep the operating system secured==
* Apply security updates on a regular basis (see  updating your VM).
* Avoid using packages from unknown sources.
* Use a recent image; for example, don't use Ubuntu 14.04 when Ubuntu 18.04 is available.
* Use SSH key authentication instead of passwords. Cloud instances use SSH key authentication by default, and enabling password-based authentication is significantly less secure.
* Install fail2ban to block brute-force attacks.

==Network security==
* Limit who can access your service. Avoid using 0.0.0.0 in the CIDR field of the security group form - in particular, don't create rules for "0.0.0.0" in the default security group, which applies automatically to all project instances.
** Be aware of the range you are opening with the netmask your are configuring.
* Do not bundle ranges of ports to allow access.
* Think carefully about your security rules. Consider the following:
** These services aren't meant to be publicly accessible:
*** ssh (22) - this service allows interactive login to your instance and MUST NOT be made publicly accessible
*** RDP (3389)  - this service allows interactive login to your instance and MUST NOT be made publicly accessible
*** mysql (3306)
*** VNC (5900-5906)  - this service allows interactive login to your instance and MUST NOT be made publicly accessible
*** postgresql (5432)
*** nosql
*** tomcat
*** ... many, many others
** Some services are meant to be accessible from the internet:
*** Apache (80, 443)
*** Nginx (80, 443)
*** ... others
* Configure your web server to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
** In many case HTTP should only be used to redirect traffic to HTTPS.
* Do NOT run a mail server.
* Do NOT run a BitTorrent server.

==Updating your VM==
In order to keep a VM's operating system secure, it must be regularly updated - ideally weekly, or as often as new packages become available. To upgrade a Linux VM choose the commands below for your particular distribution. Note you will need to reconnect to your VM after rebooting.
===Ubuntu/Debian===

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
$ sudo reboot

===CentOS===

$ sudo yum update
$ sudo reboot

===Fedora===

$ sudo dnf update
$ sudo reboot
