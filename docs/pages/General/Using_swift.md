== Object Storage in Arbutus cloud ==

The OpenStack Object Store project, known as Swift, offers cloud storage software so that you can store and retrieve lots of data with a simple API.

If you require s3 access to it, please contact our Technical support.

== Using the Object Storage via Browser ==

Swift can be accessed via the openstack cli and/or via the Cloud webinterface.

	The object storage can be accessed via the menu on the left side.
	To store data a storage container needs to be created, which can hold the data. Multiple containers can be created if required, by clicking on Public Access,
the container becomes public and will be accessible by anyone. If the container has no public access, it can only be used within the projects VMs.
	To upload files via browser into the container, click on the upload button.
