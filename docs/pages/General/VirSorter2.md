== Installing VirSorter2 in a Python virtual environment ==
These instructions install VirSorter2 in your $HOME directory using Alliance's prebuilt Python wheels. Custom Python wheels are stored in /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/custom/python/wheelhouse/. To install a VirSorter2 wheel, we will use the pip command and install it into a  Python virtual environment.

1. Load the necessary modules.

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.

3. Install VirSorter2 v2.2.4 in the virtual environment.
2.2.4
}}
4. Validate the installation.

5. Freeze the environment and requirements set.

6. Download the database in $SCRATCH with the --skip-deps-install option to bypass conda installation and also because dependencies are already installed.

== Testing VirSorter2 ==
1. Deactivate your virtual environment

2. Download the test dataset in $SCRATCH.

3. Create a submission script

3. Start an interactive job.

 salloc: Granted job allocation 1234567
 $ bash test-virsorter.sh             # Run the submission script
 $ exit                               # Terminate the allocation
 salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 1234567

Upon a successful test run, you can submit a non-interactive job with your own dataset using sbatch.
