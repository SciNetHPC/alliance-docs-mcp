Weights & Biases (wandb) is a meta machine learning platform designed to help AI practitioners and teams build reliable machine learning models for real-world applications by streamlining the machine learning model lifecycle. By using wandb, you can track, compare, explain and reproduce machine learning experiments.

== Using wandb on Alliance clusters ==

=== Availability on compute nodes ===

Full usage of wandb on compute nodes requires internet access as well as access to Google Cloud Storage, both of which may not be available depending on the cluster:

Cluster  	Wandb Availability	Note
Narval   	Limited ❌         	Users from MILA and other eligible groups only via httpproxy
Rorqual  	Limited ❌         	Users from MILA and other eligible groups only via httpproxy
TamIA    	Limited ❌         	Users from MILA and other eligible groups only via httpproxy
Fir      	Yes ✅             	httpproxy not required
Nibi     	Yes ✅             	httpproxy not required
Trillium 	No ❌              	internet access is disabled on compute nodes
Vulcan   	Yes ✅             	httpproxy not required
Killarney	Yes ✅             	httpproxy not required

== Users from MILA and other eligible groups ==

Members of the MILA Québec AI Institute may use wandb on any of our clusters with internet access, provided that they use a valid Mila-org Weights & Biases account to log into wandb. Please see the table above for more information on modules required for using wandb on each cluster.

Other groups are known to have made arrangements with Weights & Biases to bypass calls to the Google Cloud Storage API. Please contact your PI to find out if your group has made such arrangements.

== Narval, Rorqual and TamIA ==

While it is possible to upload basic metrics to Weights&Biases during a job on Narval, Rorqual and TamIA, the wandb package will automatically attempt to upload information about your environment to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, which is not allowed on the compute nodes of these clusters. This will result in a crash during or at the very end of a training run. Your job may also freeze until it reaches its wall time, thereby wasting resources. It is not currently possible to disable this behaviour. Note that uploading artifacts to W&B with wandb.save() also requires access to Google Cloud Storage and will cause your job to freeze or crash.

You can still use wandb by enabling the offline mode. In this mode, wandb will write all metrics, logs and artifacts to the local disk and will not attempt to sync anything to the Weights&Biases service on the internet. After your jobs finish running, you can sync their wandb content to the online service by running the command wandb sync on the login node.

Note that Comet.ml is a product very similar to Weights & Biases, and works on Narval, Rorqual and TamIA.

== Example ==

The following is an example of how to use wandb to track experiments in offline mode. To run in online mode, load the module httpproxy on applicable clusters and follow the comments on the example script below.

The script wandb-test.py is a simple example of metric logging. See W&B's full documentation for more options.

After a training run in offline mode, there will be a new folder ./wandb/offline-run*. You can send the metrics to the server using the command wandb sync ./wandb/offline-run*. Note that using * will sync all runs.
