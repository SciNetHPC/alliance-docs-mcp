This tutorial is strongly inspired from the OpenACC Bootcamp session presented at GPU Technology Conference 2016.

OpenACC is an application programming interface (API) for porting code onto accelerators such as GPU and coprocessors. It has been developed by Cray, CAPS, NVidia and PGI. Like in OpenMP, the programmer annotates C, C++ or Fortran code to identify portions that should be parallelized by the compiler.

A self-paced course on this topic is available from SHARCNET: Introduction to GPU Programming.
